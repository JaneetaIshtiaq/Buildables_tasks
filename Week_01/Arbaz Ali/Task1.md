# P1: 
Write a function that finds the second largest number in a list without using built-in 
sorting functions. 
# Test cases 
print(find_second_largest([5, 2, 8, 1, 9]))    # Output: 8 
print(find_second_largest([3, 3, 3]))          # Output: No second largest 
print(find_second_largest([10, 5]))            # Output: 5 
 
# P2: 
Why is a += 1 usually more memory efficient than a = a + 1 in NumPy? Whatâ€™s 
happening internally? 
# P3:
