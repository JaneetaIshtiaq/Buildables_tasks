# Buildables ML/DL Track 3 – Weekly Tasks

Welcome 👋  

Welcome to the **Buildables Tasks Repository**!  
This repo is used to collect and organize weekly tasks from all participants.  

---

## 📌 How It Works
- Every week, you will **submit your work** in this repository.  
- You **do not** have direct rights to push here.  
- Instead, you will use the **Fork & Pull Request workflow**.  

---

## ✅ Submission Steps

1. **Fork the Repo**
   - Click the **Fork** button (top right) on this repo.  
   - This creates your own copy under your GitHub account.  

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

3. **Create Your Weekly Folder**
   - Each week has a folder: `Week_01`, `Week_02`, etc.  
   - Inside your week folder, create a subfolder with your **Name**.  
   - ## 📂 Example Structure:
    
    ```
    Buildables_tasks/
    │
    ├── Week_01/
    │   ├── Ali/
    │   │   └── task_files_here
    │   ├── Sara/
    │   │   └── task_files_here
    │   └── Ijaz/
    │       └── task_files_here
    │
    ├── Week_02/
    │   ├── Ali/
    │   ├── Sara/
    │   └── Ijaz/
    │
    └── Resources/   <-- shared material for everyone
     ```

4. **Commit Your Work**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added Week_1 tasks for John_Doe"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub.  
   - Click **New Pull Request**.  
   - Target branch: `main` of the original repo.  
   - Add a clear message:  
     *Example:* `Week_01 tasks submission by John_Doe`.

## ⚠️ Rules
- ❌ Do not modify or delete other participants’ folders.  
- ✅ Only add your own work inside your folder.  
- ✅ Keep commit messages clear and meaningful.  
- ✅ Always submit work before the weekly deadline.  

---

## 📅 Weekly Structure
- `Week_01/` → Week 1 tasks  
- `Week_02/` → Week 2 tasks  
- `Week_03/` → Week 3 tasks  
- ... and so on  

---

## 🔒 Why Fork & PR?
- Keeps the main repo safe.  
- Prevents accidental deletion of others’ work.  
- Ensures every submission is reviewed before merging.
